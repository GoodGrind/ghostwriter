= What is GhostWriter?
GhostWriter helps people to catch, pinpoint and fix bugs quickly without writing any lines of extra code or deploying additional services

== How does it work?
GhostWriter takes a different approach of debugging and bug tracking by writing code instead of you at the creation of the application. When you launch the GhostWriter-augmented final product it catches unexpected errors, tracks variable states and method calls so you or your team can see what's the problem but more importantly, _why_ is it happening. You can attach any application or tool to the interface of the application and receive the messages that GhostWriter creates.

== Can you give me a more technical description?
GhostWriter is a non-invasive solution for adding common application event handler stubs to your Java code.
Essentially what you would end up writing by hand if you would like to have proper tracking of your application workflow.
After the instrumentation you will have the chance to provide custom handlers for all:

* method calls, including entering, return and exiting events
* state changes of your application, such as value assignment and other side-effectful operations
* unexpected errors

A "pseudo" before-after setup with GhostWriter (more or less readable decompiled code):

NOTE: You always see and work with your original source. The above picture is just an illustration.



= Installation

Just add the necessary dependencies to your application and GhostWriter will take care of instrumenting the https://github.com/GoodGrind/ghostwriter-api[`ghostwriter-api`] calls.

IMPORTANT: You have to choose the dependency that is inline with your Java compiler (JDK) version.

For Java 7 this means `ghostwriter-jdk-v7`, for Java 8 it is `ghostwriter-jdk-v8`.

GhostWriter is tested and verified with both Oracle JDK and Open JDK versions.

=== Maven

Add another `dependency` entry to the `dependencies` section.
This means that for JDK8, you will have the following entry in you `pom.xml` file.

[source, subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.ghostwriter</groupId>
    <artifactId>ghostwriter-jdk-v8</artifactId>
    <version>{version}</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
----

Your are done! Time to recompile your application!

=== Gradle ===

The provided snippets work with Gradle 3+.
The dependencies of GhostWriter are fetched from Maven Central. So you have to add it to your list of repositories if its not there yet.
For a project that uses JDK8, you'll will have to add the following lines to your `build.gradle` file.

[source, subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly "io.ghostwriter:ghostwriter-jdk-v8:{version}"
}
----

Your are done! Time to recompile your application!


==== For older Java versions (Java 7)

If you are still using an older Java/JDK version such as Java 7, you'll need a different set of dependencies.

*Maven*

[source, subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
<dependency>
    <groupId>io.ghostwriter</groupId>
    <artifactId>ghostwriter-jdk-v7</artifactId> // <1>
    <version>{version}</version>
    <scope>compile</scope>
</dependency>
----
<1> Note the use of `ghostwriter-jdk-v7`.

*Gradle*

[source, subs="verbatim,attributes"]
----
repositories {
    mavenCentral()
}

dependencies {
    compileOnly "io.ghostwriter:ghostwriter-jdk-v7:{version}" // <1>
}
----
<1> Note the use of `ghostwriter-jdk-v7`


Now recompile your application and if all goes well, you should now have support for plugging in runtime implementations.


==== Explicitly specifying the compile time annotation
This steps should only be done in case you manually set annotation processors (for whatever reason).
By default the compiler should pick up the GhostWriter annotation processor based on the service loader contract.

*Maven*

To have it explicitly set, you'll need to add the following lines to your `pom.xml`.

----
<build>
     <plugins>
         <plugin>
             <groupId>org.apache.maven.plugins</groupId>
             <artifactId>maven-compiler-plugin</artifactId>
             <version>3.6.0</version>
             <executions>
                 <execution>
                     <id>default-compile</id>
                     <phase>compile</phase>
                     <goals>
                         <goal>compile</goal>
                     </goals>
                     <configuration>
                         <!-- This is how we enable GhostWriter, the rest is more or less boilerplate of Maven -->
                         <annotationProcessors>
                             <annotationProcessor>io.ghostwriter.openjdk.v8.GhostWriterAnnotationProcessor</annotationProcessor> // <1>
                         </annotationProcessors>
                         <source>1.8</source>
                         <target>1.8</target>
                     </configuration>
                 </execution>
             </executions>
        </plugin>
     </plugins>
 </build>
----
<1> Make sure to use the correct annotation processor, for Java 7 this would be `io.ghostwriter.openjdk.v7.GhostWriterAnnotationProcessor`

The important part is the specification of the annotation processor using the `annotationProcessor` tag.
The rest is more or less Maven foreplay.


*Gradle*

In Gradle, that is done by adding the following snippet to your `build.gradle` file.

----
compileJava {
    options.compilerArgs = [
            // use the GhostWriter preprocessor to compile Java classes
            "-processor", "io.ghostwriter.openjdk.v8.GhostWriterAnnotationProcessor" // <1>
    ]
}
----
<1> Make sure to use the correct version, for Java 7 this would be `io.ghostwriter.openjdk.v7.GhostWriterAnnotationProcessor`

=== Is it working?

Set the following environmental variable to track what kind of code GhostWriter writes instead of you.

----
GHOSTWRITER_VERBOSE=true
----

You should see something like this:

image::media/verbose.png[ghostwriter verbose output]

As you can see there are a lot of `Note:` outputs that dump the instrumented code.

= Controlling instrumentation
In some cases you might be inclined to change the default behaviour of the instrumentation steps.
Currently there are 2 ways to do this. If you want to disable an instrumentation steps for you entire project, use the
appropriate environmental variable otherwise stick to the annotations provided by the API.

== Environmental variables
[width="100%",frame="topbot",options="header"]
|=======
|Instrumentation task|Description|Environmental variable|Default value
|Logging|Log the exact steps GhostWriter does to your application along with the pretty printed instrumented code|_GHOSTWRITER_VERBOSE_|_false_
|Overall instrumentation|Disable or enable the code instrumentation during compile time|_GHOSTWRITER_INSTRUMENT_|_true_
|Entering and exiting|Event for entering and exiting a method|Not yet supported|_true_
|Returning|Event for returning a value from a function|_GHOSTWRITER_TRACE_RETURNING_|_true_
|Value change|Event generated by value assignments and changes|_GHOSTWRITER_TRACE_VALUE_CHANGE_|_true_
|On error|Event generated by an uncaught exception in a method|_GHOSTWRITER_TRACE_ON_ERROR_|_true_
|=======


== Annotations

The fine grained instrumentation control is achieved using the `io.ghostwriter.annotation.Exclude` annotation from the `ghostwriter-api` module.

=== Exclude an entire method
By putting the `@Exclude` annotation on a method GhostWriter completely skips it.
Primary use case is to exclude the performance sensitive methods of the application.
```
@Exclude // the annotation signals the GhostWriter instrumenter to ignore this method
public int excludedMethod() {
    int i = 3;
    // ...
    return i;
}
```

=== Exclude a method parameter
Sometimes you just want to ignore some sensitive data (password, credit card number, ...) that passes through you application.
You can do so by excluding that specific parameter.
```
public void login(String userName, @Exclude char[] password) {
        // ...
}
```
In the above example, the `password` parameter and its value will not be part of the entering event.

=== Excluding local variables
Sensitive data can also occur inside method implementations, so you can also apply the exclusion to local variables as well.
```
public void buyAllTheThings() {
    // ...
    @Exclude String creditCardNumber;
    // ...
}
```


= Getting the data

Enhancing your application with GhostWriter is half the battle. You still need that data after all! With the no-operations stubs you won't get much benefit from GhostWriter, however this is where GhostWriter shines! You can leverage one of the multiple runtime implementations available or roll your own!

= FAQ

*What about the performance impact?*

By default GhostWriter uses no-op stubs, so the performance heavily depends on the runtime implementation you use.
The JVM does an awesome job of optimizing the generated code and the end performance depends on your application behaviour as well.
In case of performance critical section the instrumentation can be skipped by applying the correct annotation in order to minimize the performance overhead.

*What about 3rd party code? Will that have the same stubs instrumented*

Only if you compile that yourself. Potentially you can compile your own rt.jar with GhostWriter and have full blown coverage!
The general consideration with the compile-time instrumenter implementation is that you should focus on the code that is in your control.

*Will it mess with my stack traces? Like referring to line numbers that do not exist in my original source code?*

No. The code instrumenter implementation makes sure that it is non-invasive and your stack traces refer to the correct source lines.

*Why not a Java agent based solution?*

At the end of the day this is about trade-offs and implementation details.
With the current approach you get type-safety (the compiler verifies that the instrumented code is correct) and there is no application startup performance penalty.
Plus, once you compiled your code, it is only a matter of providing dependencies. Even if you are not in control of specifying how your application/library is used you still have tracing support.
Of course, the current implementation also has disadvantages. In the long run both compile-time and run-time implementation will be supported.
Depending on your use case (library vs. application), you can pick the one that fits your needs.
The acceptance testing infrastructure is in place for verifying the instrumentation steps, so feel free to contribute a solution ;)

*Is there a way to dump the instrumented code?*

Yes there is.
TODO: add instructions...

*Is it working with Android based applications?*

Not yet but it's very high on our priority list because current service based solutions are struggling with this problem.
